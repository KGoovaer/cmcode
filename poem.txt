Ahoy, mateys of the boundless seas, 
Where the winds whisper 'cross the trees. 
With compass true and sails so wide,
We take to waters, our hearts our guide.

The stars above, like treasure gleam,
Guiding dreams in a pirate's scheme. 
The waves do dance, they sing and call, 
Adventurous spirits, ye hear 'em all. 

Gold doubloons, a chest of lore, 
Buried deep on a distant shore. 
Arr, the sea, she be fierce and wild, 
But she's loved by every daring child. 

So here's to ye, with spirits bold, 
May ye unearth mysteries untold. 
Set yer sails and take the wheel, 
For it's a pirate's life with endless zeal!
